# Research

Our overarching goal is to explore and develop novel autonomous marine robotics platforms, afford scientists lower cost and more effective solutions to explore and exploit the oceans. 
including research on the following:

- guidance, navigation and control of underwater vehicles and ocean observation systems
- trajectory planning and adaptive sampling
- cooperative multi-vehicle
- dynamic adaptive control

To do so, we develop novel robotic platforms for autonomous marine operations and systems. Currently, we developed a novel hybrid aerial aquatic vehicle with extended endurance by merging the concepts of underwater gliders, multi-rotors, and the fixed-wing unmanned aerial vehicles together. the developed HAAV successfully realized the multi-domain motion with the three modes: underwater glide, vertical take-off, and forward flight, and the advantages of lower power consumption rate and extended moving ability were also demonstrated.
