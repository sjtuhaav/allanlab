  description:
    This paper presents a novel HAUV with better endurance by merging the concepts of underwater gliders (UGs), multi-rotors, and the fixed-wing unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) together. A mission based control strategy was then designed for the attitude control of HAUV is also a significant challenge considering the vehicleâ€™s air-water transition. Simulations composed of underwater glide, vertical take-off, and forward flight verify that the proposed HAUV successfully realized the multi-domain motion with the three modes, and the advantages of lower power consumption rate and extended moving ability were also demonstrated.

  image: Pub_comparison_optimization.png
  description:
    A QPSO algorithm is introduced for AUV path planners. Important optimization techniques applied to AUV path planning are compared in several test scenarios. Monte Carlo trials were also run to analyse the performance of these optimization techniques. The weaknesses and strengths of each optimization technique have been stated.

  image: Pub_shell_space.png
  description:
    A Shell Space Decomposition (SSD) scheme is proposed and developed to improve AUV path planners. The SSD scheme enhances the searching efficiency and effectiveness of evolutionary path planners. The proposed planner is tested to find optimal trajectories for an AUV operating in a dynamic ocean. Monte Carlo trials are used to demonstrate the robustness and superiority of the SSD based planner.

- title: "Efficient Path Re-planning for AUVs Operating in Spatiotemporal Currents"
  image: Pub_path_replanning.png
  description:
    This paper presents an on-line dynamic path re-planning system for an autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) to enable it to operate efficiently in a spatiotemporal, cluttered, and uncertain environment. The proposed strategy combines path re-planning with an evolutionary algorithm to adapt and regenerate the trajectory during the course of the mission using continuously updated current profiles from on-board sensors, such as a Horizontal Acoustic Doppler Velocity Logger. A quantum-behaved particle swarm optimization (QPSO) algorithm is used with a cost function which is based on the total time required to travel along the path segments accounting for the effect of space-time variable currents. The proposed path planner is designed to generate an optimal trajectory for an AUV navigating through a spatiotemporal ocean environment in the presence of irregularly shaped terrains as well as obstacles whose position coordinates are uncertain.

- title: "Rendezvous Path Planning for Multiple Autonomous Marine Vehicles"
  image: Pub_rendezvous.png
  description:
    A distributed shell space decomposition (DSSD) scheme is proposed for rendezvous trajectory planning of multiple autonomous marine vehicles (AMVs); this category of vehicle includes both autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) and autonomous surface vessels (ASVs). The DSSD extends the concept of shell space decomposition (SSD) by generating multiple sets of shells radiating out from the starting position of each vehicle to the rendezvous destination, enabling each vehicle to generate its trajectory within its own SSD subset. This scheme is combined with an optimized mass-centre rendezvous point selection scheme, together with a B-spline based Quantum Particle Swarm Optimisation (QPSO) technique to find optimal rendezvous trajectories for multiple AMVs with minimal travel time and simultaneous time of arrival for all the participating vehicles.

- title: "Path Planning of Multi-modal Underwater Vehicle for Adaptive Sampling Using Delaunay Spatial Partition-Ant Colony Optimization"
  image: Pub_path_multi_modal.png
  description:
    Multi-modal underwater vehicle (MUV) is a newly ocean observation platform with the capability to switch between Argo mode and glider mode. This paper presents an efficient and effective path planner to generate trajectory that exploits ocean energy and makes use of favorable ocean currents to propel and lead the MUV to collect ocean measurements located in high scientific interest areas. The proposed strategy employs MUV mode transition within path planner to enable efficient operation of MUV to drift with ocean currents for measurements and transform to operate as an underwater glider for locomotion.

- title: "Adaptive Re-Planning of AUVs for Environmental Sampling Missions: A Fuzzy Decision Support System Based on Multi-Objective Particle Swarm Optimization"
  image: Pub_apaptive_sampling.png
  description:
    This paper presents the first attempt at formulating the autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) adaptive sampling problem considering a spatiotemporal ocean environment and energy constraints. A path re-planning system that applies fuzzy logic in decision-making is then proposed to increase the sampling efficiency and reduce power consumption to complete the mission. A new fuzzy comprehensive evaluation (FCE) method, based on decision-making using fuzzy logic, is then applied to select the optimum route from the solutions by adapting and regenerating trajectories according to the ocean forecast system, analysing different scenarios, and including constraints of the total operational time and energy restrictions.
